# Laravel Product Catalog Importer

This Laravel application allows you to manage products and categories with the following features:

1. **CSV Import**: Import products and categories from a CSV file. Each product can belong to multiple categories, and categories will be created if they donâ€™t already exist.
2. **XML Feed Generation**: Generate an XML feed that includes all products and their categories in a structured XML format.

3. **Configure Environment**:

## Usage

### Import Products from CSV

To import products, place a CSV file in the `storage/app` directory. The CSV should include columns for `name`, `price`, and up to three categories. Run the import command:

```bash
php artisan import:products storage/app/your_file.csv
```


### Generate XML Feed

To create an XML feed of all products and categories, use the following route in your browser or API client:
```bash
http://localhost/products/xml-feed
```
This will output the product feed in XML format.


### Testing

Run the test suite to confirm functionality:
```bash
php artisan test
```
